The project activity was registered under Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project with
registration number 310. The crediting period of this project under CDM was 01/07/2004-30/06/2014.
PP seeks verification under UCR from 01/07/2014 onwards. Hence, there is no double counting for
the said project.

The project activity involves the development and operation of grid-connected wind based electricity
generation facilities with aggregate installed capacity of 58.2 MW. Later on, 07 WTGs of the project activity were decommissioned due to which total project
capacity was reduced to 54.02 MW.  The project activity consists of 90 WEGs of E-40 and each machine capacity is of 600 kW (E-40) totaling to
the capacity of 54.0 MW. The WEGs generates 3-phase power at 400V, which is stepped up to 33 kV and
connected to 33kV metering points. From 33 kV metering point electricity transmitted to Wind World (India)
Limited (hereafter referred as “WWIL”) Sub-station. At sub-station electricity is step-up to 132 kV. From WWIl
substation electricity is further evacuated to the state electricity grid at 132kV. The Project can operate in the
frequency range of 47.5–51.5 Hz and in the voltage range of 400 V ± 12.5%.

The wind farm is located at Soda village, in Jaisalmer District of Rajasthan state in India. The project area
is located in a wind zone of geographic location 26 Deg 54’N and 70 Deg 55’E. The sites are located at a
distance of 5 – 45 km from Jaisalmer, 300 km from Jodhpur by road. The nearest railway station is at
Jaisalmer. 

The project activity generates and sells electricity to the RRVPNL under 20 year power purchase
agreements (PPAs) under similar tariff. WWIL provides operation and maintenance services under contract
to the sponsors for the entire project activity. All the component wind farms have been commissioned, and
supplies electricity to the RRVPNL in accordance with the preferential dispatching system.

The project activity involves development, design, engineering, procurement, finance, construction,
operation and maintenance of wind energy based electricity generating stations that will provide electricity to
the RRVPNL grid under the PPAs.

Apart from the generation of electrical power, the Project also contributes to the following:

 Sustainable development, through utilization of renewable wind resources available in the region where
the Project will operate;

 Reduction of Green House Gases, specifically CO2;

 Rural and Infrastructural development in the areas around the Project;

 Capacity addition to the present installed capacity and increase in the energy availability at places of
scarcity;

 Strengthening the countries rural electrification coverage;

 Generation of permanent and temporary employment and production of indirect employment in the area;
and

 Project contribution for community development of the local rural area.

The first machine under the project activity was commissioned on 29 September 2003 and last machine
under the project activity was commissioned on 30 June 2004. The expected operational lifetime of the
project is for 20 years.

The project activity is located at Soda village, in Jaisalmer District of Rajasthan state in India. The WTG’s are
connected to Amarsagar substation. In addition to the project activity, the wind farms of non project activity
are also connected to the Amarsagar substation. Electricity delivered by all these wind farms is metered at a
common metering point. The common metering point comprises two main meters i.e. Main meter 1 and Main
meter 2 that are installed at 132 kV metering point at the Amarsagar substation. Consequently, the main
meter readings reflect the aggregate electricity supplied by all these wind farms, including the project activity
and non project activity. The net electricity supplied by individual wind turbines is determined by following a
process of allocating the total electricity (recorded at the main meters M1 and M2) to the individual turbines
in proportion of the electricity generation recorded by the (Local Control System) LCS meters at the
individual wind turbines. LCS meter records the electricity exported by the WTG to the grid which is used for
apportioning procedure.

The net electricity supplied to the grid will be calculated on monthly basis at the State utility (State utility)
substations (Amarsagar) wherein the billing meter is connected. The monthly joint meter readings are taken
by the representatives of state utility and WWIL (PP’s representative) who also signs the JMR.
Simultaneously, the monthly joint meter reading of backup meters available at WWIL pooling sub-stations
(Temedari) is also taken by representatives of state utility and WWIL. The copy of JMR at backup meters is
available with WWIL. 

The Project is operated and managed by WWIL (India) Ltd. The general conditions of monitoring are
described below :-

 Project activity consists of two metering points, main & backup metering points. Main metering point is
located at Amarsagar sub-station (33/132/220kV) which is managed by state utility (RRVPN) while
backup metering point is located at Temdarai sub-station (33/132 kV) which is managed by WWIL
(India) Limited.

 At Temdarai Sub-station there are two backup meters (Back up meters B1 & B2) which records the
electricity supplied to the grid by the project activity and non project activity WTGs at 132kV Level. From
Temdarai sub-station electricity is transmitted to Amarsagar sub-station through two EHV transmission
lines (132kV each).

 At Amarsagar sub-station there are two main meters (main meters M1 and M2) at 132 kV Level which is
connected at each 132kV EHV lines coming from Temdarai sub-station. Main meters records the
electricity supplied to the grid by the project activity as well non project activity WTGs.

 The electricity supplied to the grid will be metered at the main meters at 132 kV level at the RRVPN
substation at Amarsagar. Representatives of RRVPN/respective Discom and WWIL will take Joint Meter
reading at the main meter at Amarsagard sub-station and sign the meter readings. Simultaneously, the
Joint Meter Reading at the 132 kV level of the backup metering system at Temdarai substation (WWIL
Sub-station) will also be taken by representatives of RRVPN/respective Discom and WWIL. Main meter
reading recorded at Amarsagar sub-station will be used in ER calculation.

 Joint meter reading records the values of export & import based on which the net export by all the WTGs
(Project as well as non-project) connected to billing metering points at the DISCOM sub-station
(Amarsagar) is calculated.
