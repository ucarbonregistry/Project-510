The project activity involves the development and operation of grid-connected wind based electricity
generation facilities with aggregate installed capacity of 58.2 MW. Later on, 07 WTGs of the project activity were decommissioned due to which total project
capacity was reduced to 54.02 MW.  The project activity consists of 90 WEGs of E-40 and each machine capacity is of 600 kW (E-40) totaling to
the capacity of 54.0 MW. The WEGs generates 3-phase power at 400V, which is stepped up to 33 kV and
connected to 33kV metering points. From 33 kV metering point electricity transmitted to Wind World (India)
Limited (hereafter referred as “WWIL”) Sub-station. At sub-station electricity is step-up to 132 kV. From WWIl
substation electricity is further evacuated to the state electricity grid at 132kV. The Project can operate in the
frequency range of 47.5–51.5 Hz and in the voltage range of 400 V ± 12.5%.

The project activity generates and sells electricity to the RRVPNL under 20 year power purchase
agreements (PPAs) under similar tariff. WWIL provides operation and maintenance services under contract
to the sponsors for the entire project activity. All the component wind farms have been commissioned, and
supplies electricity to the RRVPNL in accordance with the preferential dispatching system.

The project activity involves development, design, engineering, procurement, finance, construction,
operation and maintenance of wind energy based electricity generating stations that will provide electricity to
the RRVPNL grid under the PPAs.

Apart from the generation of electrical power, the Project also contributes to the following:

 Sustainable development, through utilization of renewable wind resources available in the region where
the Project will operate;

 Reduction of Green House Gases, specifically CO2;

 Rural and Infrastructural development in the areas around the Project;

 Capacity addition to the present installed capacity and increase in the energy availability at places of
scarcity;

 Strengthening the countries rural electrification coverage;

 Generation of permanent and temporary employment and production of indirect employment in the area;
and

 Project contribution for community development of the local rural area.

The first machine under the project activity was commissioned on 29 September 2003 and last machine
under the project activity was commissioned on 30 June 2004. The expected operational lifetime of the
project is for 20 years.
